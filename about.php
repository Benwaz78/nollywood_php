                Globalization and the new economy, otherwise known as digital economy came with load of opportunities and new ways of
                doing business. Also, it came with its peculiarities and challenges to those who have no structures to avail themselves
                of this neveau digital advantage especially in marketing and distribution.

              </p>

                Similarly, the challenge thrown to the world by the recent covid-19 pandemic further complicate the case for those who
                are not already taking advantage of these digital eco system.
              </p>
              <p>
                While Nollywood contents producers have since embraced digital technology in its content creation and production, the
                same can not be said of its marketing and distribution arms thereby breaking the chain of the digital circle. This is
                the bane of the Nigerian film industry; the market changed but the marketing and distribution strategy did not.
